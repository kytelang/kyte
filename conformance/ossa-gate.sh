# QUICK spot-check (6 type-heavy cases) for fast local iteration. The AUTHORITATIVE gate is now
# CORPUS-WIDE: `conformance/run.sh --ossa [-j]` compiles every positive case under KYTE_OSSA=hard, and
# gate.sh runs THAT (Gap 3 enforcement-B, remaining-gaps-design.md). This script stays as a seconds-long
# smoke you can run by hand without sweeping the whole corpus.
#
# OSSA ownership gate: the OSSA-lite lowering + release-balance verifier (docs/design/ossa-lite-tasks.md)
# must find ZERO release imbalances (a leak or double-free it proved) on every function it fully models.
# Run with KYTE_OSSA=hard so a proven imbalance fails the compile; this script asserts no gate failure on
# a set of type-heavy programs that, together with the whole stdlib each compile pulls in, exercise owned
# locals across all control flow (branches, loops, for-in, switch, break/continue, nested scopes).
#
# Note on scope: the verifier is SOUND (it never falsely accuses) but not complete - destructured
# bindings are untracked, so a leak THROUGH a destructuring pattern is not caught here. The gate therefore
# proves "no proven imbalance", not "no possible leak". See the tasks doc.
