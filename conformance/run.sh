# exit code alone made a case that COMPILES AND CRASHES indistinguishable from one
# the compiler rejected - and that is not hypothetical: `return_type_mismatch`
# regressed to compile-and-segfault while this harness reported it PASS, and

#   typecheck      - sema/the checker emitted a diagnostic with file:line:col. The goal.

#   codegen        - rejected, cleanly, but only at CODEGEN and WITHOUT a source span:
#                    the user gets a name, not a `file:line`. Honest debt: the fix is
#                    F1 stage 7 / F2 stage 5, which move these into sema where spans
