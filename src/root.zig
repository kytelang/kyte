//! Root module of the Kyte compiler crate: the single Zig import surface that
//! re-exports the frontend pipeline and anchors the test tree.
//!
//! In Zig, one file is the crate's root (its `root_source_file`), and every
//! other module in the compiler is reached transitively through the declarations
//! it re-exports. This file plays that role. It has two distinct jobs:
//!
//!   1. **Namespacing.** It gives the rest of the codebase (and any embedder
//!      that depends on the compiler as a library) a single stable place to
//!      reach the frontend passes by name: `root.parser`, `root.sema`,
//!      `root.mono`, and so on. The `pub const X = @import("...")` lines below are
//!      not just imports; because they are `pub`, they are the public API of the
//!      crate. Callers write `@import("root").sema` rather than reaching into the
//!      `frontend/sema/...` directory layout, so the on-disk structure can move
//!      without breaking dependents.
//!
//!   2. **Test aggregation.** The `test {}` block is what `zig build test`
//!      discovers and runs. `std.testing.refAllDecls(@This())` forces every
//!      declaration reachable from this file to be referenced (and thus
//!      semantically analysed and its `test` blocks collected), and the explicit
//!      `_ = @import(...)` lines pull in modules that are NOT re-exported above but
//!      still carry tests we want run, most notably the backend codegen passes
//!      (`backend/codegen/*`) and the OSSA ownership-IR passes
//!      (`frontend/sema/ossa/*`). Without an explicit reference a module with no
//!      dependents would never be analysed, so its tests would silently not run.
//!
//! The ordering of the re-exports mirrors the compilation pipeline: lexing and
//! parsing produce the [`ast`], the [`types`] module defines the type
//! representation, and the [`sema`] passes (symbol resolution, inference,
//! monomorphisation, ownership) lower that AST into the authoritative typed IR
//! the backend consumes. Keeping them in pipeline order here is documentation in
//! itself.
