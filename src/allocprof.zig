//! Allocation profiler, an `std.mem.Allocator` wrapper that attributes every
//! live allocation to the CALL SITE that made it.
//!
//! The compiler and its runtime allocate heavily, and when memory grows without
//! bound the useful question is not "how much is live" but "which line of code
//! is holding it". This module answers that. [`Profiler`] wraps a real backing
//! allocator, forwards every operation to it unchanged, and on the side records
//! the return address of the caller (`ret_addr`, i.e. the instruction just after
//! the `alloc` call) as a proxy for the site, tallying counts and live bytes per
//! site. [`Profiler.dump`] then prints the top sites ranked by live bytes, which
//! is the leak/bloat report.
//!
//! Design decisions and invariants:
//!
//!   * Bookkeeping uses a SEPARATE `track` allocator, not the profiled `backing`
//!     one, so the profiler's own hash-map growth never pollutes the numbers it
//!     is reporting (and never recurses through itself).
//!
//!   * The profiler is best-effort and MUST NOT change program behaviour: every
//!     bookkeeping step swallows its own errors (`catch return` / `catch {}`).
//!     If the `track` allocator is out of memory a site simply goes uncounted;
//!     the profiled allocation still succeeds. Never abort the program to
//!     record a statistic.
//!
//!   * Live accounting is keyed by the returned pointer address, so `resize`,
//!     `remap` and `free` can find the owning site and adjust its live bytes.
//!     Because addresses are reused over time the `live` map holds only
//!     currently-outstanding allocations; it shrinks on free.
//!
//! Sites are printed as runtime addresses, not symbol names. [`Profiler.dump`]
//! also prints the runtime address of `dump` itself as an ANCHOR, so a caller
//! can subtract it from a site address to recover the static offset and resolve
//! the symbol against the binary out-of-band.
