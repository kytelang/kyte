//! The git-backed package manager behind `kyte get`, `kyte restore`,
//! `kyte update` and `kyte publish`.
//!
//! Kyte has no central package server: a dependency is just a git URL,
//! optionally pinned to a ref with a `#ref` suffix (a branch, tag or full SHA).
//! This module resolves the transitive dependency graph declared in a project's
//! `project.json`, materialises each dependency into a content-addressed cache
//! under `~/.kyte/cache`, and records the exact resolved commit of every
//! dependency in `project.lock.json` so a later build is reproducible.
//!
//! Design decisions and invariants:
//!
//!   * **The cache is shared and content-addressed.** A checked-out dependency
//!     lives in `~/.kyte/cache/<name>-<8-char-sha>` when it is pinned to a
//!     resolvable commit, or `<name>-branch` when it tracks a moving ref. The
//!     short-SHA suffix means two projects pinning the same commit share one
//!     checkout and a pin is never confused with a different pin.
//!
//!   * **The lock is authoritative during a build.** [`resolveTree`] in
//!     [`Mode.build`] reuses the commit already recorded in the lock (and the
//!     directory already in the cache) instead of touching the network. Only
//!     [`Mode.update`] re-fetches a moving ref to advance it to its tip. This
//!     is why `kyte build` is offline once the lock exists, and why `kyte
//!     update` is the one command that changes what a floating ref points at.
//!
//!   * **Resolution is a breadth-first worklist over sub-manifests.** Each
//!     fetched dependency's own `project.json` contributes more dependencies to
//!     the queue; a `visited` set keyed by cache directory name dedupes the
//!     graph so a diamond dependency is fetched once. There is no version
//!     unification here at the graph level: the first checkout of a given cache
//!     directory wins.
//!
//!   * **Dependencies are always git URLs.** Kyte has no package registry: a
//!     dependency in `project.json` is a `url` or `url#ref` pointing at a git
//!     repository (typically on GitHub), fetched directly. There is no
//!     `name@range` indirection and no index to consult.
//!
//! Everything is driven through git subprocesses ([`runGit`]) rather than a git
//! library, and the HEAD commit is read by parsing `.git/HEAD`, loose refs and
//! `packed-refs` by hand ([`readHeadSha`]) so no libgit dependency is needed.
//! The CLI entry points are [`ensureDependencies`] (implicit, on every build),
//! [`cmdRestore`], [`cmdGet`], [`cmdUpdate`] and [`cmdPublish`].
