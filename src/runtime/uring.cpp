// io_uring: the COMPLETION-based Linux reactor backend, the Linux peer of Windows IOCP (epoll is the
// readiness peer of kqueue). Linux-only; the whole file compiles to nothing elsewhere.
//
// Why any of this is C rather than a Kyte `extern("c")` binding, given the project's rule that
// Windows/Linux syscalls should be bound from Kyte: io_uring is not a syscall-per-operation API. It
// is two mmap'd ring buffers shared with the kernel, and advancing them correctly REQUIRES acquire/
// release memory ordering on the head/tail indices - a release store to the SQ tail is what makes
// the SQE contents visible to the kernel, and an acquire load of the CQ tail is what makes completed
// CQEs visible to us. Kyte has no memory-ordering primitives, so the ring arithmetic cannot be
// expressed there at all. The syscalls themselves (io_uring_setup/io_uring_enter) are raw here too
// because glibc does not wrap them and liburing is deliberately not a dependency.
//
// What IS exposed to Kyte is a small, stable ABI (kyte_uring_*) that hides only the ring mechanics.
