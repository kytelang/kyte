//! Interned, structural type universe for the Kyte compiler front-end.
//!
//! Every type the compiler reasons about is represented here NOT as a string
//! ("List<int>", "string?", "i64") but as a value in the [`Type`] union that is
//! then *interned* into a [`TypeStore`] and referred to everywhere else by a
//! compact [`TypeId`]. The single most important invariant this file exists to
//! guarantee is: **two [`TypeId`]s are equal if and only if the two types are
//! structurally equal.** That collapses the whole "is this the same type?"
//! question, which recurs on every assignment, argument bind, generic
//! instantiation, and ARC decision, into an integer comparison.
//!
//! Why interning and not just carrying [`Type`] values around? Two reasons.
//! First, `List<int>` and `List<string>` MUST be distinct types (monomorphs are
//! not type-erased, see the compiler's mono pass), yet the same spelling might
//! be produced by many independent code paths; interning gives them one shared
//! identity so downstream passes compare ids, not deep trees. Second, ownership
//! for ARC is decided *from the type*, never from how it was spelled (see
//! [`TypeStore.isOwned`]), a policy the codebase is emphatic about because
//! deciding ownership from a type NAME is a known source of memory corruption.
//! An interned id is the stable handle that policy hangs off.
//!
//! Structural equality is realised by a custom hash-map context ([`TypeContext`]
//! over [`hashType`]/[`eqlType`]): the store keys a `Type -> TypeId` map on the
//! type's *shape*, so re-interning an equal shape returns the existing id
//! instead of allocating a new one. Composite types (struct args, function
//! params, tuples) carry slices; the store copies those slices into its own
//! arena on first intern ([`TypeStore.own`]) so an interned type can never alias
//! caller memory that later mutates or is freed.
//!
//! A few encodings here are deliberately compact and worth flagging: SIMD vector
//! primitives are smuggled through [`PrimType.bits`] with a `lanes*1000 + count`
//! scheme (see [`TypeStore.vecU8x16T`]) rather than adding a variant, and enum
//! ownership is not intrinsic to the [`Type`], it depends on whether the enum
//! carries a payload, which is recorded out-of-band in
//! [`TypeStore.enum_tagged`] and consulted by [`TypeStore.isOwned`].
