//! Front-end, name-and-type sanity pass over a whole Kyte [`ast.Program`].
//!
//! This is the FIRST checker the compiler runs, before the authoritative typed
//! IR in `sema/` (infer/mono/ownership/lower). Its job is deliberately narrow:
//! catch the mistakes that are cheap to catch on the raw AST and turn into a
//! clear, source-annotated diagnostic, so the user sees a good message rather
//! than a downstream mono/codegen crash or a confusing `sema` error. It is a
//! best-effort structural pass, NOT a sound type system: [`resolveExprType`]
//! returns `?ast.TypeRef` and gives up (`null`) the moment it cannot be sure,
//! and every check is written to stay silent unless it is confident an error is
//! real. A false negative here is fine (the real type engine will catch it); a
//! false positive is a bug because it rejects valid code.
//!
//! What it actually enforces, roughly in the order the checks fire:
//!   - Declaration hygiene: duplicate functions (Kyte has NO overloading, see
//!     [`TypeChecker.check`]), duplicate methods/variants/type-params, structs
//!     that would be infinite-size by containing themselves by value
//!     ([`TypeChecker.checkValueStructCycles`]).
//!   - Type existence: unknown type names, and the removed 128-bit integer
//!     types, are rejected in [`TypeChecker.rejectUnimplementedType`].
//!   - Arity and narrowing on calls/constructors/closures: wrong argument
//!     counts, and the numeric-safety rules from spec F3 (no implicit narrowing
//!     int conversion, no signedness flip, no `ptr`→narrow-int truncation, no
//!     integer literal out of range for its declared type).
//!   - Control-flow: a non-void function must return on every path
//!     ([`TypeChecker.blockDefinitelyReturns`]); a `switch` over an enum must be
//!     exhaustive or have a default ([`TypeChecker.checkSwitch`]).
//!   - async/await colouring: an `async` call inside an `async fn` must be
//!     `await`ed or `spawn`ed (a bare call would block-drive the coroutine and
//!     deadlock the reactor), and `await`/`spawn`/`async` are rejected on the
//!     wasm target, which has no coroutine runtime.
//!   - Trait conformance: a `struct`/`enum` that declares `impl Trait` must
//!     supply every method with the matching async-ness, arity, parameter
//!     types, and return type (with the trait's type parameters substituted).
//!   - Module privacy: a non-`pub` field or method is only reachable from its
//!     own module (its own source file) or from inside its own type.
//!
//! Design notes worth knowing before editing:
//!   - Type names are compared through [`canonicalizeTypeName`], which folds the
//!     friendly spellings (`int`/`long`/`byte`/`double`/`u32`...) onto a canonical
//!     `iN`/`fN` name. Signedness is recovered separately from the ORIGINAL name
//!     ([`intNameSigned`]) because canonicalisation is lossy about sign.
//!   - Diagnostics are emitted TWICE by [`TypeChecker.addError`]: a plain
//!     structured record (for the LSP) and a coloured, source-quoted string (for
//!     the terminal). The pass keeps going after an error and only fails at the
//!     end of [`TypeChecker.check`] if any were recorded.
//!   - Colliding declarations (the same struct/enum name defined in two
//!     different files, tracked in `colliding_structs`/`colliding_enums`) are
//!     mostly SKIPPED rather than checked, because we cannot know which
//!     definition a use refers to and would risk a false positive.
//!   - The `isVariable*`/`exprReferences*` free functions at the bottom are a
//!     small ownership-flow helper set (does a variable get `delete`d in a
//!     `defer`, or returned) used by other passes; they are pure AST walkers.
