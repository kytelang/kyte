//! The compiler's global symbol table: a flat catalogue of every top-level
//! declaration in the whole program, keyed by name, plus the module graph that
//! tells you which file each symbol came from and which files import which.
//!
//! Kyte compiles the entire program (the root file plus every imported stdlib
//! and package module) into ONE monomorphised LLVM module, so at link time all
//! function names live in a single flat namespace. That creates two problems
//! this file exists to solve:
//!
//!   1. **Name collisions across modules.** Two different modules may each
//!      declare a `hash` function or a `Node` struct. Kyte does not erase types,
//!      so both must survive with distinct backing names. The answer is
//!      MODULE-PREFIXED MANGLING: a function `hash` in `src/std/string.ky`
//!      becomes `string_hash`. Types that actually collide get a `scoped_name`
//!      derived the same way; types that are unique keep their bare name so the
//!      common case stays readable.
//!
//!   2. **Resolving a name back to its declaration during sema.** Given an
//!      identifier at a use site (possibly qualified, like `list.push` or
//!      `collections.list.push`), find the one [`Symbol`] it refers to, honouring
//!      the importing module's view. The `findX` family walks the symbol list to
//!      do this, and reports ambiguity (more than one candidate) as a distinct
//!      answer so the caller can raise a proper diagnostic rather than silently
//!      picking one.
//!
//! The table is built once, up front, by [`SymbolTable.build`] from the parsed
//! [`ast.Program`]. It stores BORROWED slices into the AST wherever it can
//! (names, spans, and the `*const ast.*Decl` back-pointers), so it is only valid
//! for as long as the AST it was built from stays alive. The few strings it
//! must synthesise (mangled and scoped names) are allocated and tracked in
//! `owned` so [`SymbolTable.deinit`] can free them.
//!
//! **Mangling comes in two flavours, and both are kept on purpose.** The
//! `legacy_mangled`/`legacyModulePrefix` path reproduces an older, buggy scheme
//! (it leaks absolute `$HOME` path components into the prefix) so that already
//! emitted names still resolve; `canonical_mangled`/`canonicalModulePrefix` is
//! the corrected scheme that maps the same logical module to the same prefix
//! regardless of where on disk it was found. The tests at the bottom pin both
//! behaviours, including the `$HOME` bug in the legacy path, so a refactor cannot
//! accidentally "fix" the thing that must stay bug-compatible.
