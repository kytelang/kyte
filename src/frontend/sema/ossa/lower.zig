//! OSSA-lite lowering: turn a function's AST into an ownership-explicit,
//! basic-block IR so the release-balance verifier can PROVE that every owned
//! value is destroyed exactly once (no leak, no double-free).
//!
//! This is the front half of the `KYTE_OSSA` self-check. Codegen's real ARC is
//! decided elsewhere (`codegen/arc.zig`); this pass is a SEPARATE, conservative
//! model whose only job is to catch ownership imbalances at compile time. It
//! walks the typed AST, tracks the set of live owned locals in scope, and emits
//! an [`ir.Func`] made of blocks whose terminators encode control flow and
//! whose instructions are the ownership events that matter: `makeOwned` (a new
//! heap value is born), `copy` (an owned duplicate, an ARC retain of a fresh
//! reference), `borrowUse` (an owned value is read without transferring it),
//! and `destroy` (the ARC release). [`verify.verify`] then checks that along
//! every path each owned value reaches exactly one release. [`forward.count`]
//! separately tallies how many of the emitted copies are only ever
//! borrowed-then-destroyed (never moved or returned), which is headroom for a
//! later copy-elision optimisation.
//!
//! Key design decision: this is "OSSA-LITE" and it DEFERS rather than guesses.
//! Any construct whose ownership flow the model cannot represent soundly makes
//! the whole function bail out with [`Outcome.deferred`] and a [`DeferReason`],
//! instead of emitting an IR that might verify wrongly. A deferred function is
//! simply not checked; it is never reported as imbalanced. That is why the
//! coverage number (`lowered / total`) is a real metric, it is the slice of
//! the corpus the verifier actually vouches for. Deferral reasons include
//! `break`/`continue` outside a loop the model set up, a reassignment of a
//! local that pre-dates the current SSA "clone floor", `switch` cases with
//! guards, and non-block (single-statement) branch bodies.
//!
//! Ownership modelling, concretely. A scope is a stack of [`Local`]s (name +
//! [`ir.Value`] + a `live` flag). Only OWNED initialisers create a local
//! ([`isOwnedInit`] gates this); a plain-value `let x = 1` produces nothing to
//! track. Leaving a scope drops its locals in REVERSE declaration order
//! ([`dropScope`]), mirroring how ARC destructors run. `return x` moves `x` out
//! (`ret_owned`) and destroys every OTHER live local ([`dropAll`]).
//!
//! Control flow is where the SSA machinery earns its keep. Branches lower each
//! arm against a CLONE of the local stack ([`cloneLocals`]), then
//! [`reconcileJoin`] merges the arms at the join block: a local that kept the
//! same value in every arm passes through unchanged, one that diverged gets a
//! phi node, one that died in every arm becomes dead, and one that died in SOME
//! but not all arms is unrepresentable and DEFERS. Loops ([`lowerLoop`])
//! pre-scan the body for reassigned outer locals ([`collectReassignedOuter`]),
//! seed a header phi for each, and patch the phi inputs afterwards from the
//! back-edge and every recorded `continue`/`break` edge. When the loop body
//! reassigns NOTHING, no header phis are needed and a `clone_floor` is set
//! instead so that any attempt to reassign an outer local still defers rather
//! than silently corrupting the value model.
//!
//! Entry points: [`lowerFunction`] lowers one function; [`report`] /
//! [`reportQuiet`] lower every function in a program, run the verifier and
//! forwarding census, and (in `hard` mode) FAIL THE BUILD with a non-zero exit
//! if any lowered function is imbalanced. This is what the `KYTE_OSSA` gate
//! calls.
