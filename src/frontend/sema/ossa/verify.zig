//! Ownership-SSA (OSSA) balance verifier: the self-check that proves every
//! owned value in a function is consumed exactly once on every path.
//!
//! Kyte is reference-counted, not garbage-collected, so the codegen that emits
//! `kyte_retain`/`kyte_release` pairs is where memory correctness is actually
//! decided. This pass exists to catch a mistake in that emission BEFORE it
//! reaches a running binary. It runs over the ownership IR built in
//! [`ir`] (a small SSA form where each value carries an [`ir.Ownership`]) and
//! answers one question per function: does the ownership stay balanced?
//!
//! ## What "balanced" means
//!
//! Every [`ir.Ownership.owned`] value must be consumed exactly once along every
//! control-flow path from where it is produced to every function exit. The pass
//! walks each block forward, maintaining a `live` set (a bitset indexed by SSA
//! value id) of owned values that have been produced but not yet consumed:
//!
//!   * producing an owned result (any instruction whose result is `owned`) SETS
//!     its bit;
//!   * a consuming instruction (see [`ir.consumesOperand`]) or an `ret_owned`
//!     terminator UNSETS its bit, and if the bit was already clear, that is a
//!     [`Kind.double_consume`];
//!   * a borrow / borrow_use of an owned value that is not live is a
//!     [`Kind.use_after_consume`] (the value was already given away);
//!   * anything still live at a `ret_void`/`ret_trivial` terminator is a
//!     [`Kind.leak`] (produced, never consumed).
//!
//! ## How joins and loops are checked (the path-imbalance idea)
//!
//! The pass is a single forward sweep over blocks in index order, NOT an
//! iterative dataflow fixpoint. Each block's live-in set is recorded in
//! [`entry`] by the FIRST predecessor edge that reaches it (see [`edge`]); every
//! later predecessor edge compares its own live set against that recorded set
//! and reports a [`Kind.path_imbalance`] for any value that disagrees. That is
//! how "consumed on the then-branch but not the else-branch" is caught: the two
//! edges into the join disagree on one bit.
//!
//! Reassignment across a join is expressed with phi nodes, so [`edge`] applies
//! each successor phi as it crosses the edge, consuming the incoming operand
//! (the old value dies at the merge) and producing the phi result (the merged
//! value becomes live). This is what lets a loop-header phi keep an owned local
//! balanced across iterations without the sweep needing to converge: the header
//! is only visited once, and the back-edge is validated against the recorded
//! live-in rather than re-propagated.
//!
//! Because the sweep is single-pass, correctness depends on the IR being
//! well-formed SSA with phis at every merge of an owned value; the verifier
//! reports imbalance rather than looping to a fixpoint, which keeps it O(blocks
//! + edges) and terminating on any graph.
//!
//! The result always has `complete = true` today; the field exists so a future
//! bailout (e.g. a size or shape the pass refuses to reason about) can report a
//! partial verdict without the caller mistaking "gave up" for "verified clean".
