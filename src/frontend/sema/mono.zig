//! Monomorphisation worklist: which concrete generic instantiations exist.
//!
//! Kyte monomorphises generics rather than erasing them: `List<int>` and
//! `List<string>` become two distinct emitted bodies (`List_int_*`,
//! `List_string_*`), not one type-erased body that boxes its element. Before
//! codegen can emit those bodies it must know the exact SET of concrete
//! instantiations the program actually uses. Computing that set is what this
//! file does. [`Worklist`] walks every type the type checker inferred, keeps
//! only the concrete generic structs (a struct with type arguments, all of
//! which are themselves concrete), transitively pulls in the instantiations
//! reachable through their fields and method return types, and de-duplicates
//! the whole thing through a `seen` memo keyed by interned [`TypeId`].
//!
//! Two design decisions shape the code:
//!
//!   1. **This is a SHADOW pass that emits nothing.** Historically the module
//!      was the F4 stage-3 experiment that measured how much code true
//!      monomorphisation would generate versus the old type-erased scheme (see
//!      [`Worklist.report`], which prints "SHADOW, emits nothing" and a growth
//!      ratio). It graduated into the authoritative source of the instantiation
//!      list: [`Worklist.names`] and [`Worklist.instIds`] hand the collected set
//!      to the real emitter, and [`live_instantiations`] / [`live_inst_ids`]
//!      publish it as process-global state for later passes to consult.
//!
//!   2. **Concreteness and a depth bound are load-bearing invariants.** A body
//!      is only emitted for a FULLY concrete type: [`Worklist.isConcrete`]
//!      rejects anything still carrying a `type_param` or `unresolved` slot, so
//!      the compiler never emits a guess. Speculative instantiations reached
//!      through method return types are additionally capped at [`max_depth`] by
//!      [`Worklist.depthOf`], so an unbounded generic recurrence (a method that
//!      returns `List<List<...>>` of ever-growing nesting) is REFUSED rather
//!      than expanded forever, which is the classic monomorphisation
//!      non-termination trap.
//!
//! Alongside the struct worklist the file keeps three flat side-tables that the
//! rest of sema/codegen append to as they discover generic uses that the type
//! map alone does not surface: [`method_insts`] (generic method calls),
//! [`free_fn_insts`] (generic free functions), and [`base_needed`] (which
//! erased base method bodies must survive as fallbacks). These are plain
//! append-and-dedupe registries; they leak their small string/slice
//! allocations by design because they live for the whole compile and are freed
//! when the compiler process exits.
//!
//! Type rendering to a stable string name goes through `shadow.renderLegacy`;
//! lowering an AST type annotation to a [`TypeId`] and substituting a struct's
//! type parameters for its concrete arguments go through `lower.Lowerer` and
//! `subst.substitute` respectively.
