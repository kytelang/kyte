//! Expression-id assignment: give every AST expression a stable, copy-safe
//! identity.
//!
//! Later semantic passes (type inference, monomorphisation, ownership/ARC,
//! lowering) need to attach information to individual expressions and look it up
//! again from a different place in the pipeline. The obvious key, the
//! expression's address, is unusable here: Kyte's AST nodes are plain value
//! structs that get copied by value all over the compiler (stored into unions,
//! passed to helpers, returned), and a copy has a brand-new address while being
//! semantically the same node. Keying a side table on `&expr` would silently
//! break the moment a node is copied.
//!
//! This pass solves that once, up front, by walking the whole program in a
//! fixed order and stamping each [`ast.Expression`] with a small integer
//! [`ast.ExprId`] via [`Assigner.fresh`]. Because the id lives IN the node, it
//! travels with every copy, so two copies of the same expression compare equal
//! and any later pass can use the id as a dense, stable side-table key. The
//! accompanying tests spell this contract out: an id survives a struct copy, an
//! address does not.
//!
//! Two invariants make the ids usable as keys:
//!   1. Ids are handed out from `1` upward and `0` is never assigned, so the
//!      sentinel `.unassigned` (enum value 0) is unambiguous, a node that this
//!      pass never reached still reads as unassigned rather than colliding with
//!      a real id.
//!   2. The walk visits every expression reachable from a declaration exactly
//!      once, so ids are unique within a program. The traversal mirrors the AST
//!      shape node-for-node; if a new expression kind or a new expression-typed
//!      field is added to the AST, the matching arm here must be extended or
//!      those nodes will keep `.unassigned` and break whatever pass keys on them
//!      (the array-literal test guards one such gap that an earlier pass missed).
//!
//! The pass is allocation-free and infallible in practice, it only mutates the
//! `id` field of nodes the caller already owns; the `anyerror!void` signatures
//! exist so the recursive walkers compose uniformly, not because a step here can
//! fail.
