//! Best-effort type inference over the parsed AST, producing the typed IR the
//! rest of the compiler consumes.
//!
//! This is the authoritative "what type is every expression" pass. It walks
//! each function body, threads an OPTIONAL expected type inwards (so a literal
//! or closure can be shaped by its context), and records the result of every
//! expression into a [`TypedIr`] keyed by the expression's stable
//! [`ast.ExprId`]. Codegen and the ownership/ARC passes then look up those
//! recorded types instead of re-deriving them.
//!
//! The guiding principle is HONESTY over guessing. When the inferer cannot
//! prove a type it returns the store's `unresolved` type rather than a
//! plausible-looking default. That is why comparisons are `bool` (not `i32`),
//! an integer literal is `int` (not the machine word), and `a + b` over two
//! unknown idents stays `unresolved`. An unresolved result is not a hard error
//! by itself: much of the pipeline can still proceed, and the [`Stats`]
//! counters plus [`TypedIr.unresolvedCount`] give an honest coverage figure.
//! A small set of genuinely fatal cases (an unresolvable bare identifier that
//! is not a known module/builtin, or a call into a known module that names no
//! such function) are counted separately on the [`Inferer`] so the driver can
//! reject the program.
//!
//! Beyond typing, the pass doubles as a lightweight semantic checker and
//! records a family of deferred diagnostics into per-kind error lists on the
//! [`Inferer`] (visibility violations, const reassignment, dereferencing an
//! optional/error-union without unwrapping, catch-arm and try error-type
//! mismatches, non-bool conditions, returning an optional where a plain type is
//! declared, and method arity). These are collected rather than thrown so the
//! driver can report them together after the walk.
//!
//! Two features make the walk subtle and are worth calling out. First,
//! FLOW-SENSITIVE NARROWING: `if (s != undefined)` rebinds `s` from
//! `optional<T>` to `T` inside the guarded branch (and an early-exit
//! `if (s == undefined) return;` narrows the rest of the statement sequence),
//! implemented via a scoped shadow binding, see [`Inferer.narrowedBranch`] and
//! [`earlyExitNarrowing`]. Second, GENERICS: monomorphisation is driven from
//! here. When a call's type arguments can be solved to fully concrete types the
//! pass substitutes them into the return type AND notifies [`mono`] to emit the
//! concrete instantiation, so the type engine and the code emitter agree on
//! exactly which specialisations exist.
//!
//! Recursion is bounded: [`Inferer.inferExprInner`] increments a depth counter
//! and bails with `error.TypeInferenceRecursionLimit` past 2000 frames, so a
//! pathological or cyclic AST cannot blow the native stack.
