//! Shadow-diff harness for the semantic-analysis pass: it runs the NEW typed
//! engine (symbol table + [`typesys.TypeStore`] + [`infer.TypedIr`]) alongside
//! the OLD string/name-matching engine and measures where they DISAGREE, so a
//! risky migration can be proven equivalent BEFORE the old code is cut out.
//!
//! ## Why this file exists
//!
//! Kyte's compiler grew a first generation of resolution that decided almost
//! everything from mangled name STRINGS: which function a call names, what a
//! type is, and, most dangerously, whether a value is heap-owned (and so must
//! be ARC-released) by matching its type NAME. Deciding ownership from a string
//! is a corruption class in its own right (a name-match that guesses wrong frees
//! a live value or leaks a dead one, i.e. a use-after-free or a leak). The fix
//! is a real typed IR keyed on interned [`typesys.TypeId`]s. But you cannot
//! flip a load-bearing decision engine in one commit and hope; you run both,
//! diff every decision, and only cut over once the disagreement count is a known,
//! explained set (ideally zero).
//!
//! That is what this module is: a REPORT-ONLY observer. [`run`] is the entry
//! point sema calls after building the symbol table. It never changes program
//! behaviour on the happy path; its only job is to accumulate counters (the many
//! `pub var`s below) and print human-readable comparison reports gated behind the
//! `*_enabled` flags. The one place it is NOT passive is the FOUNDATION GATES:
//! when a difference is in the dangerous class (an unexplained ownership
//! divergence, an owned value the balance check cannot prove is consumed exactly
//! once, a non-`pub` symbol used cross-module), it prints a diagnostic and calls
//! [`std.process.exit`] to fail the build. That is deliberate: those are the
//! exact latent-corruption shapes the typed engine exists to eliminate, so the
//! harness refuses to let them land.
//!
//! ## The staged nomenclature (F1 / F2 / F2-6 / F4-5 / F5)
//!
//! The counter and report names carry a migration-stage tag. F1 is symbol-table
//! resolution vs the legacy suffix-scan (does the new table name the same
//! function?). F2 is the typed-IR type surface (did every declared type and
//! expression get a TypeId?). F2-6 is the ownership/temporaries pass (are owned
//! locals and temporaries provably balanced?). F4-5 is monomorphized-vs-erased
//! method resolution. F5 is the ownership DECISION diff (does `isOwnedTypeId`
//! agree with the legacy string ownership rule?). These are stages of one long
//! cut-over, not separate features.
//!
//! ## Global mutable state, and why it is acceptable here
//!
//! This module keeps its accumulators as file-level `pub var`s rather than
//! threading a context struct through every call site. That is a deliberate
//! trade: the shadow instrumentation is sprinkled across codegen and inference
//! at points where passing an extra parameter would be invasive and would
//! entangle report-only bookkeeping with real compilation. The counters are
//! written from a single-threaded compile, read only by the `report*`
//! functions, and reset per process. The `live_*` pointers ([`live_sema`],
//! [`live_store`], [`live_ir`]) and [`diff_tab`] are late-bound handles the
//! instrumentation needs but cannot receive as arguments; [`run`] and
//! [`setDiffTable`] install them.
