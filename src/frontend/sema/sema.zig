//! Semantic-analysis facade: the object that owns the compiler's typed view of
//! a program and hands its sub-passes a single place to live.
//!
//! Kyte's frontend runs several distinct passes over a program: symbol
//! resolution ([`symbols`]), lowering AST to a typed IR ([`lower`]), and type
//! inference ([`infer`]). Every one of them needs the same three long-lived
//! stores: an arena/allocator, the interned [`types.TypeStore`] that gives every
//! distinct type a stable [`TypeId`], and the [`symbols.SymbolTable`] mapping
//! names to declarations. Rather than thread those through every call site, this
//! module bundles them into one heap-allocated [`Sema`] context that the driver
//! creates once, passes to each pass, and destroys at the end. So this file is
//! deliberately thin: it is the aggregation root and lifetime owner, not where
//! the actual analysis logic lives (that is in the imported sub-modules).
//!
//! The one piece of behaviour it does own is the **type-name cache** ([`names`]):
//! a lazily populated, deduplicating map from [`TypeId`] to a printable type name
//! like `"List<int>"`. Codegen and diagnostics ask for a type's display name
//! repeatedly, and rendering it is not free (it recurses through generic args),
//! so the first caller to name a given id interns the string and every later
//! caller gets the SAME bytes back. Because [`Sema`] owns those duplicated
//! strings, [`Sema.destroy`] is responsible for freeing them. See the ordering
//! note there, which frees the cache before the stores it indexes.
