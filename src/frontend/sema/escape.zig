//! Report-only escape analysis over the typed IR.
//!
//! This pass answers one question for every heap-owning local in a program:
//! does the object it holds STAY within the function that created it, or does a
//! reference to it flow out (returned, stored into a field or container element,
//! captured by a closure, or handed to a callee that keeps it)? A local whose
//! object never leaves is a candidate for cheaper allocation strategies (stack
//! or per-request arena) instead of a full ARC-counted heap box.
//!
//! It is deliberately REPORT-ONLY. As of this writing nothing in codegen acts
//! on the result: [`analyze`] returns aggregate [`Stats`] and, when
//! [`report_enabled`] is set, prints a one-line summary. The per-request arena
//! experiment that motivated it was rolled back (ARC follows pointers across an
//! arena region, so freeing the region under a still-counted object is unsound),
//! and this file survives as the sound, non-committing substrate a future escape
//! -driven optimisation would build on. See the perf notes in the design docs.
//!
//! ## How it decides
//!
//! The analysis is a two-layer fixpoint.
//!
//!   * OUTER (interprocedural): [`analyze`] iterates over every function up to
//!     24 rounds, recomputing each function's "which parameters escape" summary
//!     ([`mergeSummary`]) until no summary changes. Summaries only ever GAIN
//!     escaping parameters (monotone), so the fixpoint is guaranteed to settle;
//!     the 24-round cap is a belt-and-braces bound, not the expected exit. A
//!     call to a not-yet-summarised or unknown callee is treated pessimistically
//!     (every argument escapes), which keeps the result a sound over-approximation
//!     regardless of visitation order.
//!
//!   * INNER (intraprocedural): [`computeEscapingAndAllocs`] seeds a per-function
//!     escaping set from the direct escape sinks (returns, field/index stores,
//!     closure captures, escaping call arguments) and then closes it over
//!     assignment EDGES (`lhs = rhs` between plain identifiers) so that if `lhs`
//!     escapes then `rhs` does too. This flow closure is itself a small fixpoint.
//!
//! Everything works on borrowed slices from the AST and the typed IR; the only
//! owned state is the summary vectors and transient sets, all freed before
//! [`analyze`] returns. Allocation failures are swallowed (`catch {}` / `catch
//! continue`): a dropped edge or summary can only make the result MORE
//! conservative (more things marked escaping), never unsound, so the pass never
//! fails the build.
//!
//! ## Soundness direction
//!
//! Every approximation here errs towards "escapes". Missing an escape would be a
//! correctness bug (an object freed while still reachable); spuriously marking
//! something as escaping only forfeits an optimisation. That asymmetry is why the
//! unknown-callee, allocation-failure, and non-identifier-LHS cases all default
//! to marking escape.
