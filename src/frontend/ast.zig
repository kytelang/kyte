//! The Kyte abstract syntax tree: the parser's output and the shape every later
//! compiler pass reads.
//!
//! This file is nothing but data definitions. It declares the whole tree of
//! nodes the parser builds from a source file, from the top-level [`Program`]
//! down to individual [`Expression`] leaves. There is no behaviour here on
//! purpose: the AST is a plain, pass-agnostic description of "what the
//! programmer wrote", and the phases that give it meaning (the type checker,
//! the `sema/` typed-IR passes, and codegen) live elsewhere and only consume
//! these structs. Keeping the tree behaviour-free is what lets several passes
//! share one representation without coupling.
//!
//! A few conventions run through the whole file and are worth stating once:
//!
//!   * **Spans travel with every node.** Almost every struct carries a [`Span`]
//!     so that a diagnostic raised in a late pass can still point back at the
//!     exact source text. The parser fills these in; nothing downstream should
//!     need to reconstruct a location.
//!
//!   * **Slices are borrowed, ownership lives in the arena.** Every `[]const u8`
//!     name and every `[]T` child list is a slice into memory the parser's
//!     arena allocator owns. AST nodes never free anything; the arena is
//!     released wholesale once compilation of a unit is done. This is why it is
//!     safe to alias, copy, and point into these structs freely.
//!
//!   * **Recursion goes through single-pointer indirection.** Where a node
//!     contains a child of its own kind (an [`IfStmt`] branch that is itself a
//!     [`Statement`], a [`BinaryExpr`] operand that is itself an
//!     [`Expression`]), the child is stored behind a `*` because Zig cannot size
//!     a directly self-embedding struct. Lists of children, by contrast, are
//!     ordinary slices.
//!
//!   * **Tagged unions model "one of N node shapes".** [`Declaration`],
//!     [`Statement`], [`ExprKind`], [`TypeRef`], [`Literal`], and [`Attribute`]
//!     are `union(enum)`s: the tag says which grammar production matched and the
//!     payload carries its fields. Downstream passes switch on the tag.
//!
//! The statement/expression split mirrors the language: Kyte is expression-
//! oriented in places (see [`IfExpr`] and `block_expr`), so a handful of
//! constructs appear both as a [`Statement`] variant and an [`ExprKind`]
//! variant with slightly different shapes.
