//! Code-coverage block registry for the LLVM codegen backend.
//!
//! When Kyte is compiled with coverage instrumentation enabled, codegen needs
//! to (a) assign a small, stable integer ID to every source construct it wants
//! to count, and (b) emit a durable, out-of-band description of what each ID
//! means so a post-run report can map raw counters back to file/line/column.
//! This module is that bookkeeping half: [`CoverageRegistry`] hands out the IDs
//! during compilation, and [`CoverageRegistry.writeMetadataFile`] serialises the
//! ID → location table to a sidecar JSON file. The actual runtime counters (the
//! per-ID hit array bumped at execution) live elsewhere; this side only owns the
//! metadata that gives those counters meaning.
//!
//! The central invariant is ID stability: the ID for a given block must be the
//! same every time that block is asked about within a single compile, so codegen
//! can emit a counter increment against it and the metadata will agree.
//! [`CoverageRegistry.registerBlock`] enforces this by de-duplicating on
//! `(file_path, line)`, asking twice about the same line returns the first ID
//! rather than minting a new one. IDs are simply the insertion index into
//! [`CoverageRegistry.blocks`], which keeps them dense and contiguous (`0..N`) so
//! the runtime can size its counter array as a flat `[N]` and index directly.
//!
//! The metadata writer deliberately uses libc `fwrite`/`fopen` via `extern`
//! rather than Zig's `std.fs`/`std.json`: it hand-rolls a tiny JSON emitter with
//! manual escaping so it has no dependency on the JSON stringifier and stays a
//! self-contained C-FFI leaf. The output filename `__kyte_cov_metadata.json` is
//! fixed and written to the process's current working directory.
