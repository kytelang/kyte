//! ARC (automatic reference counting) code generation.
//!
//! Kyte has no garbage collector. Every heap object carries an 8-byte header
//! (refcount at offset -8, byte length at offset -4), and the compiler emits
//! `kyte_retain`/`kyte_release` calls so that objects are freed exactly when
//! their last reference goes away. This file is the part of codegen that
//! decides WHERE those calls go and, crucially, MANUFACTURES the destructor
//! functions that `kyte_release` invokes once a refcount hits zero. It is a
//! companion to `expressions.zig`/`statements.zig` (which call in here at
//! binding, return, and scope-exit points) and sits directly on top of the
//! LLVM C API via [`core`].
//!
//! ## The two questions this file answers
//!
//! 1. **Disposition** ([`acquisitionDisposition`], [`Disposition`]): when an
//!    expression's value flows into a new home (a `let`, a container slot, a
//!    struct field), does the destination TAKE ownership of an existing object
//!    (so we must `kyte_retain` it, because the source still names it too) or
//!    CONSUME a fresh temporary (so we just move it, no retain)? Naming an
//!    existing owner (`x`, `obj.field`, `arr[i]`) borrows; a constructor call
//!    or literal produces a fresh owned value. The authoritative answer comes
//!    from the typed-IR ownership pass; the `principled*` helpers here are the
//!    fallback and the shadow-diff cross-check.
//!
//! 2. **Destruction** (the `getOrCreate*Destructor*` family): given a type,
//!    synthesise (once, memoised by mangled symbol name) an LLVM function
//!    `__destruct_<mangled>` that releases everything the object transitively
//!    owns. Each type SHAPE gets its own layout-aware walker: plain structs
//!    release owned fields at their byte offsets and recurse into inline
//!    value-struct fields; tagged enums branch on the tag word and release the
//!    active variant's payload slots; tuples and error-unions release owned
//!    elements/arms; `Storage<T>` loops over its element slots; trait objects
//!    dispatch through the vtable (slot 0 is the concrete destructor); closures
//!    call the captured environment's cleanup then free the box.
//!
//! ## Two parallel destructor engines, kept in agreement
//!
//! Destructors can be built from a TypeId (`*ByTypeId`, driven by the typed-IR
//! [`typesys.TypeStore`]) or from a legacy type-NAME string (the plain
//! `getOrCreate*Destructor` variants). The string path is the historical one;
//! the TypeId path is the accurate one. [`getOrCreateDestructorPreferId`] uses
//! the TypeId whenever its mangled symbol matches the string's, and the
//! `diff*` helpers, active only under `sema_shadow.report_enabled`, count how
//! often the two engines agree so the string path can eventually be retired.
//!
//! ## Value structs vs reference types
//!
//! A `struct` is value-semantic: its bytes live inline in its owner, so it is
//! never refcounted itself, but a copy must deep-retain any owned FIELDS it
//! holds and a drop must release them. That is why copies (see
//! [`buildTupleDeepCopy`]) call `retainValueStructOwnedFields` and drops (see
//! [`dropValueStruct`], [`releaseLocalByName`]) call the value-struct
//! destructor directly rather than `kyte_release`.
//!
//! ## Optimisation and self-verification passes (module-level, opt-in globals)
//!
//! After the module is built, three whole-module passes run over raw LLVM IR:
//! [`elideBorrowedArc`] removes retain/release pairs on values that never
//! escape (redundant and borrow-only), [`arcCensusBefore`]/[`arcCensusAfter`]
//! measure how much ARC traffic exists and how much MORE could be elided, and
//! [`verifyArcBalance`] is a fail-closed self-check that every provably
//! non-escaping owned slot has acquires == releases (an imbalance is a leak or
//! double-free the compiler itself introduced). Each is gated by a global flag
//! wired to an env var, so they cost nothing unless asked for.
//!
//! ## Fail-closed on un-typeable values
//!
//! If a value reaches retain/release with no concrete type ([`unresolvedDtorField`],
//! the placeholder branch of [`legacyStringOwnership`]), this file aborts the
//! compile with a "please report" message rather than emitting a free of an
//! object whose layout is unknown: guessing would corrupt memory, so a compiler
//! bug is surfaced loudly instead of silently miscompiled.
