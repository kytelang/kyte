//! The LLVM code-generation backend: the compiler's final lowering stage, where
//! the type-checked Kyte program becomes an LLVM module ready to be optimised and
//! emitted as a native object (or a WASM module).
//!
//! This file defines [`LlvmCompiler`], the single large stateful object that owns
//! the whole codegen pass: the LLVM module and IR builder, the target machine, all
//! the symbol tables carried over from the frontend (structs, enums, unions, traits,
//! constants, functions), the caches that make per-expression type resolution cheap,
//! and the debug-info (DWARF) machinery. Every other file in `codegen/` hangs methods
//! off this struct rather than defining a parallel state object, which is why the
//! bottom of this file is a long list of `pub const foo = other_module.foo;` lines:
//! they graft the methods implemented in `arc.zig`, `types.zig`, `statements.zig`,
//! `expressions.zig`, and `declarations.zig` onto [`LlvmCompiler`] so that, from a
//! caller's point of view, `self.compileExpression(...)`, `self.compileRetain(...)`
//! and the local helpers here all live on one object. The split is purely to keep
//! each source file to a workable size; semantically it is one class.
//!
//! Key design decisions and invariants this file embodies:
//!
//!   - **One machine word is `i64` (`val_type`).** Almost every Kyte value flows
//!     through codegen as a 64-bit integer, whether it is a real integer, a float
//!     bit-cast into a word, or a heap address. Heap addresses MUST stay 64-bit:
//!     computing `addr + offset` at `i32` truncates the pointer and produces a
//!     wild address, which is the single most common class of miscompile here.
//!     Pointer-sized helpers ([`LlvmCompiler.ptrElemSize`], [`LlvmCompiler.valSlotSize`])
//!     exist because WASM is a 32-bit target where a word is 4 bytes.
//!
//!   - **Monomorphization, not type erasure.** Generics are instantiated per
//!     concrete type argument. [`LlvmCompiler.collectFunctions`] walks every struct
//!     method and free function and, for each recorded instantiation (from
//!     `sema/mono.zig`), registers a distinct mangled `FunctionInfo`. An erased
//!     "base" body is emitted only as an `internal`-linkage fallback that later
//!     dead-code elimination usually drops. [`LlvmCompiler.expandFreeFnInstsTransitively`]
//!     fixes the point where one generic instantiation calls another until no new
//!     instantiation is discovered.
//!
//!   - **ARC, decided in codegen.** There is no garbage collector. Ownership is
//!     resolved here and in `arc.zig`: heap objects carry an 8-byte header
//!     (refcount at -8, length at -4), `kyte_retain`/`kyte_release` bracket
//!     borrows and drops, and value structs are copied inline with their owned
//!     fields deep-retained. This file provides the allocation primitives
//!     ([`LlvmCompiler.compileAlloc`], [`LlvmCompiler.compileAllocPersistent`],
//!     [`LlvmCompiler.compileFree`]) and the WASM in-IR allocator
//!     ([`LlvmCompiler.generateWasmMemoryFunctions`]); the retain/release policy
//!     itself is grafted in from `arc.zig`.
//!
//!   - **Traits dispatch through fat pointers.** A trait object is a two-word heap
//!     block `{struct_ptr, vtable_ptr}`; vtable slot 0 is always the destructor and
//!     slots 1..N are the trait methods in declaration order. See
//!     [`LlvmCompiler.getGlobalVTable`], [`LlvmCompiler.constructTraitObject`] and
//!     [`LlvmCompiler.buildTraitVtableCall`].
//!
//!   - **Value optionals ("valopt") are a real ABI, not just null.** A value type
//!     wrapped in an optional (`int?`, an unowned enum, or a nested `int??`) is
//!     boxed so that "present zero" is distinguishable from "absent". The
//!     [`LlvmCompiler.valueOptionalInner`] / [`LlvmCompiler.valoptDepth`] pair and
//!     the `buildValopt*`/`coerceValoptArg` helpers implement the boxing rules and
//!     the depth-matching a call site needs when an argument is more deeply boxed
//!     than the parameter expects.
//!
//! The debug-info half of the file (all the `di*` helpers) builds DWARF only for
//! native, non-release builds; every one of those functions is a no-op when
//! `di_builder` is null, so callers never have to guard the debug case themselves.
